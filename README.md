<h2 align="center">Project Description</h2>
Our goal is to build a model that will accurately predict an NBA player's 2K rating, for the video game series NBA 2K, based on their performance the previous season.  Players in the game are typically given an "overall" rating on a 1-99 scale that determines their in-game
performance.  We are also aiming to identify the statistics that are the most "important" or "relevant" to their rating.
