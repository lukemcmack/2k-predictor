<h2 align="center">Project Description</h2>
Our goal is to build a model that will accurately predict an NBA player's <b>2K rating</b>, for the video game series <b>NBA 2K</b>, based on their performance the previous season.  Players in the game are typically given an "overall" rating on a <b>1-99 scale</b> that determines their in-game performance.  We are also aiming to identify the statistics that are the most "important" or "relevant" to their rating.

<h2 align="center">The Data</h2>
<h3 align="left">Sources</h3>
Our real-life NBA season statistics are taken from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com">basketball-reference.com</a>. <br>
Our 2K rating statistics are start-of-season ratings (since the 2K games update their overalls throughout their 1-year live service period) taken from <a href="https://hoopshype.com/nba2k/2024-2025/">HoopsHype</a>, a subsidiary of USA Today Sports.
